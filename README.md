Hi team,

I wrote a script for email filtering. There are 5718 emails in total, and 3038 unique emails after remove all the duplicates.

I assign each domine a KeyWord Similarity score. The keywords are automobile/EV related keywords. Higher the score, more related for the website to the automobile/ EV industry. The output is file attached in the attachment or   here. My code is available here: code.py. I wish the excel sheet is helpful.


Meaning of the score:
-1	The website is not accessible by the program, but doesn't mean it is not a valid website. Might need to recheck. Some websites block Python script access.
0	The website's main page doesn't have any keywords related to automobile industry
>1	There are information on the first page that is related to the automobile industry

If you have questions, please let me know. 
Thanks
